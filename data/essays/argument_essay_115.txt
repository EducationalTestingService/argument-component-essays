In his Nobel Peace acceptance speech , Elie Wiesel says , Sometimes we must interfere .
When human lives are endangered , when human dignity is in jeopardy , national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant .
In saying this , he is suggesting that countries around the world should always be there to fight for each other when there is persecution in another country ; that a country should always take action if there is another part of the world that is facing oppression .
Wiesel 's statement is both right and wrong .
Most people would automatically agree with him because the idea of helping others is always encouraged , but giving a homeless person your spare change is a lot easier for people to do than it is for a whole country to fight for another .
Persecution is a horrible thing that should always be stopped , but interfering with foreign affairs is not always the safest thing for a country to do .
There have been many times throughout history when a country has gotten itself into another country 's problems , and at times it has been for the better , but other times for the worse .
It is expected of a country to interfere if it is beneficial to everyone involved , but if interfering will hurt the country trying to help , they ca n't be expected to risk their security for another country 's safety .
