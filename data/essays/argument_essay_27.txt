Antidepressants that cause suicidal thoughts or violent acts in adolescents should not be prescribed ?

Antidepressants should not be prescribed because they still have a chance to worsen these feelings or actions in adolescents .
Antidepressant medications are widely prescribed to try to decrease the symptoms of depression and to reduce the risk of suicide .
However , reducing depression is not the only reason why antidepressants can increase the chances of a person committing suicide .
As antidepressants became more commonly prescribed for anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder , the reports of patients ' suicidal thoughts and actions became more worrisome to physicians and family members .
If a depressed adolescent on antidepressants is suicidal , that is not so surprising , but if someone who was not depressed and taking antidepressants for other reasons becomes suicidal , which has happened , that raises questions about the safety of these medications .
This evidence shows that antidepressants could cause depression suicidal thoughts or violent actions in adolescents .
Knowing this , parents could not have their child take these medications , that have a risk of increasing their chances and not helping with their actions or thoughts .
