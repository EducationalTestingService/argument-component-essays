Romeo and Juliet PBA Argument Essay

People argue whether life is predetermined to be a certain way , or we are responsible for our future .
Some religions say that a superior entity chose the whole world 's course and this can not be changed .
This idea is often called fate or destiny .
however , is it worth to live if no matter how intense you try , your existence will be the same ?
The tragedy Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare describes how the personal choice of two wealthy families of despising each other provoked the death of six people .
In the literary criticism of Romeo and Juliet is a terrible play and David Leveaux Ca n't change that , Alyssa Rosenberg critiques how immature behavior of the two young lovers was the reason of their tragic ending .
Noah Berlatsky clarifies in In defense of Romeo and Juliet : it 's not childish it 's * about * childishness that the play is compelling because it explains maturity and innocence .
The debate is about what caused the tragic ending and the situation of the play .
Personal choice has a greater impact on the characteristics in Romeo and Juliet since most of their difficulties were a consequence of their actions , they had the power to solve their problems , and they were in control of their lives .

First of all , it can be argued that the situations of the play were a result of the characters ' decisions .
It is shown throughout the play how the characters are carried away by their emotions and caused problems .
What readers should understand is that Juliet and Romeo asked the Nurse and Friar Lawrence to help them become husband and wife , and they accepted .
Romeo had to convince the Friar to marry them , and he accepts because he wants peace for the city .
by contrast , in the case of the Nurse , she accedes and always supports Juliet without apparent reason .
Yet , this is because she raised Juliet , and she desires Juliet 's happiness .
In the text , the Nurse states that Marry , bachelor , Her mother is the lady of the house , And a good lady , and a wise and virtuous .
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
( Shakespeare 1.5 pg .

This means that she believes that any man who marries the child she raised would be a lucky man since Juliet 's family , the Capulet , possessed a lot of riches .
This illustrates that the Nurse wanted Juliet content because she loves her .
It shows how the Nurse not only accepts to help them but also encourage Romeo to marry Juliet because she was aware that Juliet fell in love with him .
Unfortunately , that marriage and love that the Nurse and Friar Lawrence encouraged and supported , was one of the main reason that led to the suicide of these two young lovers .

Characters were able to resolve their problems properly ; but , they decide to escape them , which demonstrates that personal choice drove them to their death .
To better understand the situation , during the whole play , no one ever speculates why the families ' resentment was sanguinary , mutual , and along in years .
Most of the citizens with it , as it would be a common thing to be either a Capulet or a Montague , and detest everyone who is part of the opposite house .
Romeo and Juliet were not an exception .
They rather committed suicide instead of finding a way to transform Verona into a place where they could love each other .
In the article , Romeo and Juliet is a Terrible Play , and David Leveaux Ca n't Change That is stated that the vision of Romeo and Juliet 's deaths uniting their families is an adolescent fantasy of death solving all problems , a ` wo n't they miss me when I ' m gone ' pout .
( Rosenberg , pg # 507 )
This means that they had the idea that if they died , they would save the day .
It is a way of romanticizing mental illness , which is a common thing with young adults .
This clarifies that they were immature and this induced them to believe that they had no other option , but to kill themselves .
although , they never tried another way to resolve their obstacle .
By making this decision , they showed how infantile and unreasonable they were .
Additionally , how they never confronted their difficulties and that created more consequences .

A common argument against this position is that Romeo and Juliet 's love and age was not a coincidence .
They were star - crossed lovers who were destined to die together and finalize the tension in Verona .
To explain further , there is a belief that the young lovers were on earth with a purpose .
It was to find each other and mend the complications that the citizens of Verona were obligated to confront on a daily basis .
In the article In Defense of Romeo and Juliet : It 's not childish , it 's * about childishness , Noah Berlatsky explains , Old / young remains an obsession throughout the play . ..
Sometimes , it means being a hope for the future --- as when Friar marries the couple to try to end the feud between Montagues and Capulets ( Berlatsky pg .

This illustrates that their innocence and poor maturity was not the reason of their death .
It was their fate because they were the only hope for their natal city and for the enemy houses to be able to coexist efficiently .
This could be possible because their death unified and brought peace for the city .
The evidence , however , overwhelmingly supports my argument that personal choice was the main reason of the principal concepts of the play because they demonstrated that their actions were controlled by themselves and their emotions and not their fate .
In other words , they were able to react in a way they showed their emotions and their own satisfaction .
As an example , Romeo killed Tybalt as a result of the anger and hate he felt after the death of his loved cousin Mercutio .
This clarifies that they were in control of their actions and lives .

In conclusion , decisions and actions of the characters of the play defined the situations because they were facing consequences , they could have changed their lives , but never tried , and they were not controlled by a superior entity .
Throughout the play , they were not critically thinking their actions , and were managed by their heart .
This led to the main problem of the play .
They never tried to solve their problems in a hasty manner , neither be comprehensible and clear .
This provoked the characters to maintain secrets and not help .
It is true that they may have achieved their sacred purpose of bringing peace to Verona .
They were not controlled by something greater than life itself , because their actions demonstrated that they were in control of their lives .
