Should College prices be Lowered ?

Did you know that 60 % of Americans feel we should have tuition free college ( Anderson , Tom ) ?
Also , college graduates earn $ 1 million more in earnings over their lifetime ( Cornerstone University ) .
Education prices should be lower because everyone deserves to have some sort of education .

College is a natural extension of elementary and high school ( Deborah Kurfiss ) .
Students with low - income can not afford 95 % of colleges in the United States ( Allie Bidwell ) .
This shows that prices on college really need to improve .

According to the College Board , the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2017 - 2018 school year was $ 34,740 at private colleges , $ 9,970 for state residents at public colleges , and $ 25,620 for out - of - state residents attending public universities ( CollegeData ) .
This is another example of why 95 % of young adults can not afford college .

But , how will colleges make any money to help support the college with everything it needs ?
The prices do not have to drop to zero , they just need a little negotiating .
In exchange for a reduction in tuition , students could perform services on campus .
Such as mowing grass , cleaning classrooms , working in the kitchen , etc .
The number of students projected to attend American colleges and universities in fall 2018 is 19.9 million , which is lower than the enrollment peak of 21 million in fall 2010 ( Center for educational statistics ) .

Our economy now requires a better educated workforce ( Deborah Kurfiss ) .
95 % of young adults can not afford college , which also means that they are not going to be able to get a good job , with a reasonable pay to help support there future family .
If students are willing to keep their grades up , help the professors and around campus , there should be a reduction in the price of tuition .
The students will have to work hard and contribute more towards their education .
