Do Video Games Make You Violent

Have you ever wondered if video games make you violent ?
Is it true that video games cause school shootings , robbing , or even speeding ?
The answer is no .

The reason is that why would anyone shoot anyone because of a video game ?
And if they do start a shooting or something horrible like that , it is for another reason , like family problems .
There is no proof that the video games cause violence , people just blame it on them .
If you play three hours of Call of Duty you might feel a little bit pumped , but you are not going to go out and mug someone .
BBC .
No matter how violent or bloody the game is , it will not cause violence .

But , even the government gets into this situation .
And if they do n't cause violence , why do they put an age limit on the game cover .
And what else would be the cause for the school shootings .
