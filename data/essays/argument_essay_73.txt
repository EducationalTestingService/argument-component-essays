Student Athletes Being Drug Tested ? !

The question of should , student athletes be drug tested to see if they 're allowed to play is a very debatable topic .
In my opinion , I believe teens , in general , should be drug tested and , in this essay , I 'll be explaining my decision .
Many people believe they should n't be drug tested , for various amounts of reasons , from kids not playing sports anymore to their rights being violated .
This topic is a chaotic one , but I 'll explain the positive effects of doing this maybe even life saving choice .

First , I 'll go over the safety of an adolescent if they 're drug tested .
According to FCD Prevention Works there are lists and lists of negative effects of doing drugs at such a young age .
Doing drugs can cause addiction , mental health problems / disorders , drugs also can affect your brain , heart , sleeping , eating , stimulants , and this list goes on .
Teens tend to do drugs for many reasons like peer pressure , relief , popularity , and so on .
When doing drugs it releases a chemical into the body known as dopamine , which is the feel - good hormone .
Dopamine is the reason why you get addicted and then it creates hallucinogens which makes you see things that are not there , hallucinate .
Which leads to depressants inhibiting , which means everything in your body slows down .
This does end up killing brain cells , that keep you up and going , which can create depression , anxiety , adhd , and many other mental health issues or disorders .

Next , I 'll go over a teens potential being at stake when being under the influence .
As a consequence , of being under the influence you have no say in what occurs .
According to Hilary Connery , a clinical director of the division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse , teens have gotten more unplanned pregnancies or had sex while being under the influence .
Another keypoint made by the National Institute on Drug Abuse was , the negative effect of teens learning skills .
Due to an adolescents brain still in progress of developing , their brain then struggles with controlling their emotions , physical coordination , motivation , and their judgement , says Partnership for Drug - Free Kids .
This does lead to random mood swings , depression , irritation , and basically put a child into that typical teenager phase as most parents call it .
Just know this is n't just a phase it could be a lifetime recurring situation if they become addicted to whatever substance they are using .
This will make their school life much more challenging and they will change who they are as a friend , person , even as your son or daughter .

Lastly , I 'll be going over how a teens future may be at loss .
If they had a child and continued to do drugs , women specifically , they will affect the growth of the fetus .
The fetus consumes basically whatever you as the mother consumes from food to drugs .
According to Drugs and Alcohol Information and Support , when doing drugs while pregnant , it will affect your baby 's eyes , ears , teeth , palate , central nervous system , heart , lower / upper limbs , and their external genitalia .
Being pregnant and using substances will cause birth defects , the size of the baby , mental / behavioral problems , premature labor , miscarriages , stress , and make you and your baby 's life just miserable .
Yet another example of how drugs will affect a teen 's future can be depending on their reliance of their choice of substance .
What I mean by that statement is , depending on how much you rely on a substance can influence what you rather buy , for instance , would you rather buy clothes or alcohol .
Surely , this does n't seem that big of a deal at first , but just wait until you constantly are spending your money for drugs or alcohol .
Next , you will not be eating due to your lack of money .
This then leads to you losing your house , so you 're on the street , but you offer to do anything since your mind and body now relies on getting and using your choice of substance .
This scenario did escalate quickly , but I did that purposely , so you can understand how fast things happen .
To the point you wo n't even get time to change your mind since it is already confiscated by drugs being your priority .

In conclusion , I believe teens should be drug tested .
Whether they are playing sports or not , but that is my opinion and I explained why in the paragraphs above .
I understand both sides of this debatable topic , but I strongly believe my side is stronger than the other side , which is they should n't be drug tested .
My concluding point , or lingering thought is , will kids not be a part of sports due to being drug tested and other fears of people finding out the results ?
