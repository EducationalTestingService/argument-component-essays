On August 31 , 1837 , Ralph Waldo Emerson gave his speech , The American Scholar , at Cambridge .
In this speech , Emerson outlines how he believes that Americans could become more than just the jobs they provide .
He then discusses the duty scholars have to be not just readers of books or regurgitator of others ideas , but instead to become a man thinking .
Emerson uses this idea to push American scholars to bring new , American ideas into the world instead of old , English ones .
The question is whether or not Emerson 's plan from almost 200 years ago has any place in the world of today .
In many ways , Emerson 's plan is even stronger today than when he wrote it .
In today 's world , jobs and careers are highly specific , new ideas have difficulty gaining traction , and nature is becoming increasingly difficult to connect with .

The first way Emerson 's plan connects today is that in any workplace it is easy to feel more like a cog in a machine and less like an organ in an organism .
Emerson argues that there are two states within a man working .
One which is divided and one which is elevated .
The work done by a person in either state is no different , but the perception is .
The divided man sees himself as merely a job or a result of a job .
The elevated man sees himself as a man providing a necessary service for the rest of mankind .
This mindset can help people from feeling that what they are doing is meaningless .
Emerson describes this as the difference between a mere thinker and a Man Thinking .
Any person could be a Man Thinking , but only some take on that role and that is their contribution to humanity .
