The sinking of Indianapolis could have been prevented .
If the word gets spread , the more sharks know the more of a shark frenzy .
There has to be the blood of swift movements because it will the hard bones , not like fishbone where fish bones are flexible .
But if there 's blood flowing they 'll eat .
Example when people shark fish they chum the water with blood and meat and fish .
Also when people jack ( fish ) fish sharks can come and eat them if you do n't reel fast enough .

People were blaming the deaths on the captain but it was the sharks who killed them .
Whenever a boat sinks or people die on a boat most times it sharks eat them or drag them away .
Sharks ca n't help it they are n't thinking oh a human let 's not eat it .
They take a bite first to check if it is edible .
Unless they are really angry .
Shark attacks can not be solved
