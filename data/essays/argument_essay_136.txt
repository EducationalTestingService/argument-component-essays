Why sharks should be protected

Sharks are amazing creatures people just do n't notice it .
Sharks are not the threat humans are .
They see us as seals and other things that they eat so they attack us but us we just kill them for their fins .
Sharks should not be hunted because only about 3 people are attacked a year by sharks but 100 million sharks are killed by us .
Many sharks help to keep our ocean healthy they normally target the weak and sick fish and look at the bull the bull eats almost everything and we kill them .
Sharks are amazing creatures we just do n't see it .

It 's pretty bad when we call sharks the killer but when we kill them one thousand times more than they kill us .
Scientist where sharks and found out that about one hundred million sharks were killed each year , sharks are normally killed just for their fins sort of like the manta ray .
If we keep on killing some of these species of sharks , in general , can go extinct .
The only reason sharks would attack humans is because we look like a seal or a turtle which both of them are two animals that they eat sow they would mistake us for what they normally eat .
When you look at a surfer from bathing theme they have the shape of a turtle or seal and sharks see you they think food because they need to survive too so they will attack and this normally does n't happen .

Do you know what happens to sharks when they are caught ?
Once a shark is caught most of the time their fins will be cut off then put back into the water left to die .
Killing the sharks is bad because they help keep the ocean clean by killing all of the more old and sick fish .
About every ten seconds , ten sharks are killed .
That may not seem like a lot but just think how many 10 seconds go by in a day .
