Argument Reflection

I learned a substantial amount of information during this unit .
One of the biggest things I learned is that my perspective is not always right .
The minute Lila , Seth , and I were assigned to negative side for the vegan debate , Lila and I attacked each other .
Back and forth we argued over whether or not humans should be vegan .
That night I went home and did research .
After studying the issue , I detected that any diet is good for you if you do it right .
Another valuable lesson I learned was , the more evidence you have the more powerful your argument is .
A debate or essay without evidence is just an opinion , and is not powerful .
Evidence and strong facts are required to influence your readers point of view .
People can argue peacefully using words and feelings .
Argument is an important skill that should be learned by everyone .
It can create bold and independent individuals .
How can we make a difference in the world if we do not know how to express our beliefs ?

During this unit I failed a lot .
Although , to learn you have to fail .
The first time I chose a topic , I struggled a lot with my warrants and evidence .
I spent multiple class periods searching for valid information , and discovered nothing .
Eventually Mrs. Gray suggested I change my topic .
I took her advice and started fresh .
With my new topic my research thrived , I started to succeed and my argument skills increased .
Teamwork is another valuable skill I used during debates .
My team and I split up and wrote different parts of our debate , but supported each other when we needed help .
In order to successfully persuade humankind we must express our evidence and research .
Investigation and communication can effectively share one 's point of view .
I learned a ton from this unit , but still have room to improve .
Argument is an invaluable skill that I will use for the rest of my life .
