The Holocaust is one of the best examples of injustice in history .

In the book Upon the Head of the Goat , Aranka Siegal relates her personal experiences through the character of Piri and tells readers of the horrible massacre and treatment she and her family went through .
What Piri and her family experienced is what millions of other Jews also went through across Europe .
The author writes this book in a way to make readers feel her pain and experience what she 's going through .
Readers feel sadness and sympathize with her .
Feeling the emotion of sadness makes readers wish that the Holocaust never happened , which makes people want to stop injustice from happening .

One example of the injustices that the Jews faced in the story was with Joli and Sandor in the Ghetto .
They are described as thin and pale : their energy in play has greatly diminished ( Siegal , 175 ) .
This makes readers sad because Joli and Sandor are young kids who are malnourished and not very active .
Kids need to exercise , play , and receive the proper amount of food and water to be healthy and survive .
The quote When the Germans see what is happening , they say that we are swine and do n't need water , ( Siegal , 164 ) proves my statement to be true .
The quote proves that because the Germans are clearly saying that the Jews are swine and that they do n't need water .
The mix of hearing those words , thin and pale , the Germans saying that

Jews do not need any water or food , and then calling the Jews pigs makes readers feel sad and hope injustices do not happen in the future .

Another example of sadness is when Iboya and Piri are chased by boys with sticks outside of the synagogue .
According to the book they stopped in at Farkas & Fӧldes to get some notebooks and look through the new rental book ( Siegal , 52 ) .
When they were done at the store and returning home they heard loud shouting and saw several old men , prayer shawls still over their shoulders , running from the courtyard into the street .
Three boys were among the men with sticks in their hands .
` Stop ' , I screamed or ` I 'll get the police ' .
Seeing us directly across the street from the synagogue , they yelled , ` There are two of those Jew girls , ' and came toward us .
We started to run as fast as we could . ..
we could hear the boys gaining on us .
` Dumb Jew bitches , we ' ll pound your asses you wo n't get away .
Get the one with pigtails , the one who yelled she would call the police . '
They mimicked my voice .
` What police is she going to tell ?
As if they cared about our beating up some old Jews ( Siegal , 52 ) .
This quote makes readers feel sad about what Piri and Iboya went through .
It proves that since Iboya and Piri were doing nothing wrong .
They simply told the boys to stop vandalizing and hurting the men in the synagogue and said if they do not they will get the police .
Then these boys decided to chase after Iboya and Piri with sticks saying vulgar and offensive language and threatening to hurt them according to the quote , Dumb Jew bitches , we 'll pound your asses , you wo n't get away .
Get the one with the pigtails , the one who yelled she would call the police ( Siegal , 52 ) .
This makes readers have sympathy for Piri and Iboya which in return makes readers stop injustices from happening in the future .

The final example of sadness is when Piri remembers her childhood in Beregszasz .
When Piri is on the wagon , taking her and her family to the Ghetto , she has a flashback and states , As we passed it , I remembered falling into a pond at the edge of the park years before .
I had been wearing a white pique dress at the time .
Lured by the sight of some delicate blue flowers at the rim of the pond , I have , in reaching out and pulling them from the moist earth by their roots , lost my balance .
I slid into the pond , white dress , patent leather shoes , and all .
I climbed out and saw that my dress was covered with green slime , and my shoes sloshed with muddy water .
When I got home , Mother had to leave the company she was entertaining to clean me up , and she was angry .
From my perch in the wagon I could see the same blue forget - me - nots blooming .
No one else noticed them ( Siegal , 152 )
According to the quote she would play by the pond with beautiful blue forget - me - nots and that one time she fell in and Mother even had to leave the company she was entertaining to clean , her up .
Those were fun days in the past but now with the Germans taking over and sending Piri and her family to the Ghetto , those days seem like their over as they approach the end .
The quote From my perch in the wagon I could see the same blue forget - me - nots blooming .
No one else noticed them , ( Siegal , 152 ) symbolizes that they are approaching the end and that those memories are fading away slowly as their future fades away slowly too .
This injustice makes readers wish that the Germans never did this to the Jews which conclusively makes readers want to stop injustice from happening again .
