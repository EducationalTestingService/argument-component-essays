Vaccinations should be mandated in all 50 states .
Preventable diseases with vaccines such as , measles , whooping cough , and mumps have been making a comeback thanks to the Anti - Vaxxers .
The Anti - Vax movement started because of Dr. Wakefield who conducted research on vaccines causing autism without ethical approval from the hospital he practiced at .
Over the years other researchers struggled to prove his claim .

An investigative journalist named Brian Deer published an article about Dr. Wakefield 's research and in that article Deer states that he found inconsistencies in a number of the paper 's case studies and questioned how impartial the research was , ( Bad Science ) .
Even after a decade and scientists disproved his research , people still are n't vaccinating their children .
There have been 101 cases of measles that have been reported in 10 states since the beginning of 2019 . ..
( Fisher ) .

For many diseases children , and in particular young children , are at the highest risk of the disease and also have the most severe illness .
The best way to protect someone against a disease is to vaccinate them directly , rather than rely on ` indirect ' protection through herd immunity .
If someone who is unvaccinated does meet the germ responsible for that disease they will be completely susceptible .
There will always be some children who can not be vaccinated for medical reasons - most commonly because they are too young or because they have a problem with their immune system .
It does n't take much of a drop in the number of people vaccinated in a population for herd immunity to be less effective and this is n't then a reliable way of protecting a child .
