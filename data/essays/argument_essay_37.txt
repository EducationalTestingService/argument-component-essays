Common Task 6.1 Argument : Preparedness ( Scouts honor )

There are many reasons why the three boys in Scout 's honor were not prepared .
By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail .
Benjamin Franklin .
By not planning you will not succeed is what the quote is referring to .
So , if you want to do a good job at something be prepared and plan things out first .
In the short story Scout 's Honor the boys did not actually plan out what they were gon na do so they failed to do what their goal was .
One way this is shown is when Horse forgot to bring an can opener to eat beans .
For example , in the story Horse says , Forgot to bring a can opener .
That 's why Horse was not prepared because he forgot a can opener to eat beans .
Another way they were not prepared is the way Max was silly and started a food fight and the food fell .
Another example , in the story , is when Max says Suddenly Max shouted , Food fight !
Food fight !
And began to paw the stuff off and fling it around .
In seconds , the lean - to was down , the fire kicked over , and Max 's frankfurters dumped on the ground .
That 's why they were not prepared because they ruined Their food .

Lastly , the way they were not prepared was when they forgot to bring a blanket .
The last example is when Max and Avi say Max eyed me . Did n't you say you brought a blanket ?
No way !
I cried .
That 's why they here not prepared because they forgot a blanket .

The boys learned that they should have been prepared because after all of that happening they decided it was best to go home .
Therefore the boys were not prepared .
In the real world prepare before you do something because you will be successful with whatever you want to do but if you do n't be prepared there will be more consequences because you do n't know what you are getting your self into .
