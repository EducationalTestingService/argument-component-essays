I choose this quote because it demonstrates that war does not only affect you physically , but it also takes a toll on your mental health .
This quote also represents that the physically affects of war can be treated , while the emotionally affects are harder to fix .
This is reveals to the reader that in a big country one side could be in total chaos , while the other is living a normal life .
This goes to show that people can not truly understand war until it happens to them .

My imagination at ten years old did n't have the capacity to grasp what had taken away the happiness of the refugees ( Beah 6 ) .
I selected this quote because in it , it shows that when he was ten years old , Ishmael still had a normal and happy childhood .

Its importance to the text is that in this statement it tells that war can complety destroy peoples ' lives .
Through this quote it demosrates to the reader that war is something that should be the last option .
