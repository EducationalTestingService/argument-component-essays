Should SeaWorld Be Shut Down ?

Five of the orcas living at SeaWorld today were stolen from their families in the wild .
For example , Tilikum was a whale who was taken from his ocean home when he was only 2 years old ( 8 Shocking Facts About SeaWorld ) .
There are hundreds of thousands of sea creatures that have been captured and taken to SeaWorld .
When animals come to SeaWorld , they constantly wonder if they ever get to go back home and see their families .
They are living beings , not toys .
All of the animals feel pain , grief and anger .
Those emotions can lead to actions , in which can seriously injure people .
SeaWorld must be shut down because it is keeping wild animals in captivity .
It 's cruel and harmful to the animals and is not safe for the public or trainers .

Keeping any wild animal in captivity is wrong .
They deserve to live out their entire life the way they were born to , and nobody has any right of taking that privilege away .
Although SeaWorld workers may often say that the animals at SeaWorld live longer in captivity , that is very incorrect .
The lifespan of wild orcas is remarkably long , with females living up to 80 to 100 years or more , while males can reach around 60 years of age .
Contrary to claims by marine park animal trainers about an extended lifespan in captivity , it is apparent that their lives are cut short , with the majority having died by the age of 25 , most commonly from infection ( The Fate of Captive Orcas ) .
Not only is SeaWorld is giving false information about their animals , they do not care to address the common issues of these captive sea creatures .
From intentionally flinging themselves out of their tanks to swallowing inedible stones , many dolphins and orcas have decided a life in a tank is a life not worth living .
There have been many records of captive cetacean suicide attempts ( 10 Signs Whales and Dolphins Do NOT Belong in Tanks ) .
Therefore , these animals are in more danger the longer they live in captivity .

The animals at SeaWorld live in a harsh and cruel environment .
The 5,000 to 8,000 pound orcas live in tanks not even 40 feet deep .
The trainers put black zinc oxide on the orcas to cover up the blistering sunburns from the orcas shallow tanks .
Although black zinc oxide can be used to prevent sunburns , the trainers at SeaWorld mostly use it to hide how bad the orcas burns are .
Carol Ray , a former trainer who also worked at the Orlando park , said that when she applied the substance ( black zinc oxide ) to a male orca , burnt layers of his skin would peel off in her hands ( Cronin ) .
These animals are being neglected and do n't belong in a terrible place like SeaWorld .

SeaWorld never has and never will be safe for anyone .
Not the animals , the trainers or even the public .
Despite their apparent friendliness at marine parks and aquarium shows these large animals have been known to occasionally attack their trainers when they feel threatened or emotionally unstable these attacks can and have happened .
In some cases a killer whale would grab hold of the trainers limb or hair and pull them under water until they drown ( Are Killer Whales Dangerous ? )
.
In 2010 the senior trainer at SeaWorld , Orlando was killed by Tilikum during a show .
This woman , Dawn Brancheau was a very talented and safe trainer and what happened was not her fault .
Animals at SeaWorld are wild , aggressive animals and nobody can change that .
Not only did that event occur , but there are many other cases of aggression towards SeaWorld visitors .
In 2012 , 8-year - old Jillian Thomas was feeding fish to a dolphin at SeaWorld Orlando 's Dolphin Cove .
When she picked up the paper carton used to hold the fish , a dolphin lunged to grab it , biting her hand in the process .
The girl sustained puncture wounds , and the animal may have ingested the entire paper carton ( 6 Ways Dolphins and Whales are Still Suffering at SeaWorld ) .
Animals at SeaWorld unfairly have to suffer from their actions , when after all , they are wild animals that we have absolutely no control over .
SeaWorld is n't safe for anyone and should not be able to continue business in the United States and beyond .

SeaWorld is holding wild animals in constant captivity , treating living creatures cruelly and is not considering the safety of its visitors and residents , therefore must be shut down .
While it is true that it is important for people to see wildlife , SeaWorld is a very wrong way to do so .
For decades SeaWorld would send people to find animals such as baby orcas and steal them from their mothers and families .
Animals living at SeaWorld do not lead a healthy life due to their poor living conditions and diets .
Not only do they not have a reason to be at SeaWorld but they are used for human entertainment and are forced to do tricks they may not want to do .
They can not speak for themselves and are stuck living miserable lives , possibly injuring themselves and others .
Kind hearted people must save these animals because if they do n't , who will ?
